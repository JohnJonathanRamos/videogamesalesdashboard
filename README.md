# Video Game Sales Dashboard
This dashboard project performs an end-to-end analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing over 64,000 video game titles. The dataset includes regional sales figures across North America, Europe, Japan, Africa, and other global markets.

# Key Insights
  The total global sales amount to $6.61 billion, wherein North America (NA) accounted for approximately 51% of total sales ($3.35 billion), Europe and Africa (PAL) for $1.92 billion (approximately 29%), Japan (JP) for $687.94 million and the rest of the world for $651.12 million where both accounted for approximately 10%.

The North American region is clearly the most dominant market, contributing over half of total global sales, and should be prioritized for strategic targeting.

Sales have notably reached their peak between 2005 and 2010, followed by a significant downward trend in the following years.

‘Grand Theft Auto V’ leads all game titles with sales of $64.3 million, accounting for more than twice the sales of the second-ranking title. The Call of Duty franchise also demonstrated relevant market sales, occupying six of the top ten positions.

In terms of revenue, the top-performing genres are the following:
- Sports: $1.2 billion
-	Action: $1.1 billion
-	Shooter: $995.5 million
-	
These figures reflect a strong consumer preference towards competitive and fast-paced genres.

The PlayStation 2 (PS2) leads platform sales with $1.0 billion, followed by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 (PS3). This trend corresponds with the observed peak sales period during the mid-2000s to early 2010s, a time when these consoles were at the height of the gaming market.

# Summary

# Conclusions
